## Introduction
This is a small project i wanted to setup to learn some typescript and especially NestJs.
The real application is getting data from a api that returns energy consumption of a person but I cant use the API in a public repository.

Instead I used the public API of the danish energy ministry to get some data.

This project so far also only implements login and register endpoints, and a data collections service that collects data from the api and stores it in the local sqlite database.
